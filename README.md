#  Movie Recommendation System Using Collaborative Filtering

Project Overview: 
This project implements a Movie Recommendation System using Collaborative Filtering. The system predicts and recommends movies to users based on user preferences and similar users' behavior. The system is built using Python and leverages the MovieLens dataset for its implementation.

Key Features: 
Collaborative Filtering Algorithm: Recommends movies by analyzing users with similar tastes and preferences.
Pearson Correlation: Used to compute similarity scores between users based on their movie ratings.
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing ratings, extracts relevant features, and cleans the dataset for better recommendations.
Weighted Average Approach: Generates movie recommendations using a weighted sum of similarity scores and user ratings.
Technologies and Tools
Python: Main programming language used for implementation.
Pandas & NumPy: Libraries used for data manipulation and numerical computations.
Visual Studio Code: Code editor used for the development of the system.
Draw.io: Tool used for diagramming flowcharts and visual representations.
MovieLens Dataset: Dataset containing movie ratings and user preferences used to train and test the recommendation system.

How the System Works:
Data Collection: Uses the MovieLens dataset to collect user ratings and movie information.
Data Preprocessing: Cleans the data by removing unnecessary information and handling missing values.
Similarity Calculation: Uses Pearson Correlation to find users with similar tastes.
Recommendation Generation: Recommends movies based on the similarity scores and ratings from similar users.
Evaluation: Performance is measured by comparing predicted ratings with actual ratings from users.
Future Enhancements
Hybrid Approach: Combine content-based filtering with collaborative filtering for better accuracy.
Sentiment Analysis: Incorporate social media data and user sentiments to improve recommendations.
Deep Learning: Use machine learning libraries like PyTorch to uncover hidden patterns for more personalized recommendations.
Conclusion
This project presents a basic implementation of a collaborative filtering-based movie recommendation system. While it provides reasonably accurate predictions, future improvements can be made by exploring hybrid approaches, larger datasets, and more advanced algorithms.
